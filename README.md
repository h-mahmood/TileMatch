## Tile Match

This Android application was created as a part of the EECS 481: Software Engineering course at the University of Michigan. The goal of the course was to create software that helps elderly patients in the ICU with their physical and mental rehabilitation.

Tile Match is a game that tests the patient's memory by having them remember and match the positions of different tiles on a board. It features multiple difficulty modes to make it accessible to patients in varying stages of rehab. It also has the ability to search the device for pictures to be used as the game background, so as the patient solves more of the puzzle, they can start to see more of the picture and exercise their brain attempting to remember who the people in the picture are.
